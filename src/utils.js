/**
 * The APP_SECRET is used to sign the JWTs which you’re issuing for your users.
 *
 * The getUserId function is a helper function that you’ll call in resolvers which require authentication (such as post). 
 * It first retrieves the Authorization header (which contains the User’s JWT) from the context. 
 * It then verifies the JWT and retrieves the User’s ID from it. 
 * Notice that if that process is not successful for any reason, the function will throw an exception. 
 * You can therefore use it to “protect” the resolvers which require authentication.
